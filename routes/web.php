|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| YOUR TASK — register the routes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The five controllers imported above are already written for you. Your job
| is to wire each one up with a full set of CRUD routes.
|
| Every controller has these methods: index, create, store, edit, update,
| destroy  (there is NO `show` method). The quickest way to register all of
| them at once is Route::resource().
|
| IMPORTANT: the controllers redirect to route names such as
| 'students.index', so the resource name MUST match this list exactly:
|
|     departments  ->  DepartmentController
|     students     ->  StudentController
|     courses      ->  CourseController
|     professors   ->  ProfessorController
|     enrollments  ->  EnrollmentController
|
| TODO:
|   1. Add a route for '/' (e.g. redirect to one of the modules).
|   2. Register a resource route for each of the five controllers.
|      Remember to exclude 'show'.
|
| One worked example — write the other four yourself:
|
|     // Route::resource('departments', DepartmentController::class)->except('show');
*/

// TODO: write your routes below this line.
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('auth.login');
})->name('login');

Route::get('/layout', function () {
    return view('layouts.app');
})->name('layouts');
